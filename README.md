# JAVA OCP 1Z0-830 Exam

Attempting the #100DaysOfJava / [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge to improve my Java understanding and eventually take/pass the OCP [#1Z0-830](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-21-developer-professional/pexam_1Z0-830) exam.

Currently reading the Sybex book "[OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 21 Developer Study Guide](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1394286619)" by Jeanne Boyarsky & Scott Selikoff; & working through Tim Buchalka's "[Java Masterclass 2025: 130+ Hours of Expert Lessons](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course)" course on Udemy.

Going to be using this repo as a scratch area for the examples in the book/udemy course and general messing about with the concepts outlined within it. 

Will be publicly committing to the challenge on BlueSky here: [keirwhitlock.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/keirwhitlock.bsky.social)
